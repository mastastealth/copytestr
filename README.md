A tiny, simple (jQuery) script that basically makes all major
headings and paragraphs editable. Why would you do this? In my case 
it helped coordinate with a copy editor. To avoid having them mess around 
in the HTML, I made this so they can just try out different texts in
the browser itself, nothing more, nothing less. :D
